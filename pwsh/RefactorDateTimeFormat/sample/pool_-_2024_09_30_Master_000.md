#### issue

- solution

  - this issue is not caused by ``Out-FileUnix``
  - the shell is actually updating the list of files whose content is being read by ``cat``
  - since the file name matches the wildcard pattern, it gets caught in the read stream and starts reading and writing into itself indefinitely

- howto

  ```powershell
  cat pool*.md | Out-FileUnix pool_-_2024-09-30_Master.md
  ```

- actual

  - hangs indefinitely

- note
  - ~~the ``chore`` task(s) need(s) to be systematized~~
  - ~~``recite``: Some passages are hard to recall when I need them. It may be because I only learned to memorize them in sequence with other passages, so I simply rely on momentum to get through a recitation. The only way to prime these passages is to recite a whole chapter or a very large section of Scripture. I may need to take some time to study the passages I've memorized.~~

### 2024-07-05

- note
  - ~~emp: CodeNinjas: checking the Homebase app is part of the ``correspond`` task~~
  - ~~the task logs are all technically journals~~
  - ~~I need sticky notes: action items that activate according to an event or condition (e.g. when I enter a specific environment).~~
  - ~~In order to be effective, projek task items need to involve more than just practice and exposure. Time should be spent working on a large or difficult project every day.~~
  - ~~Spend a day journaling or mapping parts of the story that come to mind.~~
  - ~~The ``clean`` task is an _incremental_ task. The idea is to leave each space you visit just a little cleaner than when you entered or when you last saw it.~~
