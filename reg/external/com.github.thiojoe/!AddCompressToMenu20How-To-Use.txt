How To Use:

    1. Choose which version you want to use:
       - "Full Menu" Version: The same as the original one in the new context menu, and has multiple sub-menu items
       - Other Version: Doesn't have a sub-menu, it just directly opens the "Create Archive" menu. (The equivalent of clicking the "Additional Options" sub-item in the original)
    
    2. Double click the "Add_" reg file of whichever version you choose
    
    3. Restart Windows Explorer
       - You can restart it by opening Task Manager with Ctrl+Shift+Esc, then search it for "Windows Explorer", right click that and hit "Restart"
       - You can also just restart the whole computer of course

Technical Explanation / Notes For Anyone Curious:

   - This won't overwrite any existing registry entries or anything, it only creates a couple new ones
   - You could add both versions and they'll both be there. They're independent, so if you add both, you'll need to remove both separately too using theire respective "Remove_" reg files.
   
   - The tweak basically works by copying the registry entries that makes the command appear in the 'new' start menu, and adds them to the old menu as well
   - Behind the scenes, the "Create Archive" menu is given the command name "Windows.CompressTo.Wizard" which exists at: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\CommandStore\shell\Windows.CompressTo.Wizard
      - The full "Compress To" menu has the command name "Windows.CompressTo" which exists at: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\CommandStore\shell\Windows.CompressTo
